Job posting for CTO co-founder at aether.

# CTO Co-Founder (AI/ML & Decentralized Multi-Agent Systems)

## About Us
We’re building an innovative AI startup that’s redefining what autonomous systems can achieve. Our project (currently in stealth) focuses on solving complex, real-world challenges through decentralized, multi-agent orchestration, robust memory management, and iterative self-improvement. We’re tackling problems that require deep technical innovation and a commitment to both safety and scalability.

## Who We're Looking For
We’re searching for an AI-savvy technical mastermind to join us as a CTO co-founder. You’ll be responsible for shaping our technology strategy, building production-grade AI systems, and leading our engineering team from the ground up. This is a high-impact role—if you’re passionate about pushing boundaries and thrive in a fast-paced startup environment, we want to hear from you.

## Key Responsibilities
- **Multi-Agent System Design:** Architect and implement robust systems that coordinate specialized AI agents (e.g., planning, research, execution, and oversight) using consensus and safety mechanisms.
- **Scalable AI Infrastructure:** Build end-to-end AI pipelines—from data ingestion and preprocessing through to model design, training, and cloud deployment using tools like Docker, Kubernetes, and MLOps frameworks.
- **Advanced Memory & Data Management:** Develop sophisticated memory layers (vector databases, knowledge graphs, versioning) that ensure long-term context retention and traceability.
- **Decentralized Technologies Integration:** Leverage blockchain/IPFS for auditability and secure, trustless operations.
- **Continuous Self-Improvement:** Implement controlled, RL-driven processes and automated testing pipelines for autonomous system optimization.
- **Leadership & Stakeholder Engagement:** Lead technical teams, influence product direction, and confidently articulate our AI vision to investors and partners.

## Critical Requirements
- **Computer Science degree**
- **AI/ML Expertise:**  
  - 4+ years of hands-on experience building and deploying machine learning or deep learning solutions.
  - Strong background in neural network architectures (especially transformers) and familiarity with reinforcement learning/self-improvement methodologies.
- **Multi-Agent Systems:**  
  - Demonstrable experience (or deep technical knowledge) in designing and managing systems with multiple, specialized AI agents that collaborate through orchestration and oversight.
- **Data Engineering & MLOps:**  
  - Proven ability to build scalable data pipelines, and deploy models using modern frameworks (TensorFlow, PyTorch) and cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, or Azure).
- **Decentralization Knowledge:**  
  - Familiarity with blockchain technologies (e.g., Ethereum, Solana) and decentralized storage (e.g., IPFS) is highly desirable.
- **Leadership & Startup Mindset:**  
  - Experience in technical leadership or managing engineering teams.
  - A proactive, entrepreneurial spirit with the ability to thrive in a rapidly changing startup environment.
- **Investor and Communication Skills:**  
  - Ability to clearly articulate complex technical concepts and your vision to investors and stakeholders.
- **Location & Language:**  
  - Must be based in the US and fluent in English.

## How to Apply
Please do not submit a generic resume. Instead, include:
- A concise portfolio or case study (maximum 2 pages) that highlights major AI/ML projects you’ve led, especially those involving multi-agent systems, scalable deployment, or decentralized technologies.
- A detailed summary of technical challenges you’ve solved and your approach to overcoming them.
- A brief statement on what motivates you and why you’re excited by this opportunity.
